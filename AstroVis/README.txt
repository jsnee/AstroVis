*** BEFORE YOU RUN THE PROGRAM ***
1. Make sure you unzip the data.zip to your desktop
2. Compile the code in Xcode (The latest version of Xcode may be necessary)

If there are issues:
1. Verify the HOME environment variable is your Users directory
2. Verify that on your desktop is the data folder which contains several files
    (if you unzip from your desktop, sometimes it can place the data folder into a
        folder with the title of the zip file. So make sure your data folder isn't
        inside of another data folder)
